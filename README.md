# Sudoku Solver

## Overview

This is a Sudoku solver built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The solver utilizes a backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle and provides an interactive user interface to input Sudoku puzzles and see the solutions. The solver also validates the input to ensure the puzzle is valid before solving it.

## Features

- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Solves any valid Sudoku puzzle using the backtracking algorithm.
- **Interactive Input**: Allows users to input Sudoku puzzles via a grid of text fields.
- **Validation**: Ensures that the Sudoku puzzle is valid before solving.
- **Clear Functionality**: Provides an option to clear the board and reset the puzzle.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How to Use

1. **Input the Sudoku Puzzle**:

   - The cells will be highlighted with a different background color if left empty.

2. **Solve the Puzzle**: 
   - Click the "Solve" button to solve the puzzle. The solution will automatically appear in the grid.
   
3. **Clear the Puzzle**:
